# CPP-OpenGL-Training-App
A C++, OpenGL and GLSL test program used for to develop my programming skills in both language and framework.

## Objective
The User controls a camera flying around in 3d space using KB+M to view different lighting techniques, shadows and surfaces, and moving models. There is no objective or gamified element and is instead a showcase of my programming and development in this difficult framework. Reading the files will provide insight into how I developer the shaders in GLSL and the techniques used to create shadows and objects.

## Note
This program will not run without the following requirements (please check main.cpp for #includes).
This application was originally known as "OpenGLCourseApp" as this had originally started as a course I was following, but I have renamed it since I diverged.

## Requirements
Assimp,
GLEW,
GLFW3,
GLM,
GTC.

STB_Stage_Implementation is also necessary however this file is included. The other frameworks above are too large. Edit the main.cpp file includes for the correct folders if you have installed these. Ensure your IDE knows the whereabouts of these libraries too.

## Controls
WASD for movement and Mouse for aiming. You are flying in 3d space but are limited and will not flip over as if there was no up or down axes. 
Push Escape to exit.
